            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHat greater Ble≈ø≈øing can fall to the ≈øhare of any Kingdom, or People on Earth, than to be Governed with Uprightne≈øs, and Truth; to ≈øee her ≈øelf fenced about with Ju≈øtice and Judgment; her Laws, that are her ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, to run ≈ømooth in an interrupted Chanel of Impartiality, where no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption can turn them a≈øide to de≈øtroy the Innocent, nor free the Guilty? in ≈øuch a Ca≈øe, I ≈øay, a Nation is happy, and this depends mainly on the ≈øupreme Power; for where the Fountain runs with a Chry≈øtal Stream the Waters are plea≈øing, and de≈øirable; they refre≈øh
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110034:4"/>the fainting Heart, and ≈øpread a Joy through tho≈øe that partake of them; but when it proves the contrary, no ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is rendered; for according to the Saying of the wi≈øe Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.2. <hi>When the Righteous are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the People rejoice: but when the Wicked beareth Rule the People mourn.</hi> And we find that when God more immediately de≈øigned to favour his People <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> he gave them his Servant <hi>David</hi> to be their King, and to Reign over them; and with him he gave them Plenty in their Gates, and Victory over their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, brought under the Oppre≈ø≈øour, and the Spoiler was no more ≈øeen in the ≈øtreets, the Cries of the oppre≈ø≈øed were turned into Songs of Deliverances, and they were made to hear of Joy and Gladne≈øs; for how plainly may we behold in Holy Writ the Face of things to be changed, and that People, who but a little before were compelled to bow their Necks to the Yoke of the <hi>Phili≈øtines,</hi> a cruel and mercifull Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, had their Lands wa≈øted and ≈øpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, looking every moment to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed, ≈øuddenly rai≈øed to unexpected Advantages; their Enemies were put
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110034:4"/>to flight, they had Peace in their Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, their Vineyards, and Olive-yards flouri≈øhed, and Corn and Wine encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, ≈øo that they might conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, by a ≈øudden and unexpected Change, more happy than the Nations round about them, and it mu≈øt con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be a greater ≈øatisfaction to any People, and create in their Minds a larger ≈øen≈øe of Joy, and thankfull Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, to be ≈ønatched from a Chaos of Di≈øorder and Confu≈øion, threatning every moment Ruin and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation, into Calmne≈øs, Serenity, and a pro≈øpect of la≈øting Tranquility, than if they had been in no ≈øuch Danger. Holy <hi>David</hi> gives extraordinary Prai≈øe and Acknowledgment on this occa≈øion, P≈øalm 124.6, 7, 8. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed be the Lord, who hath not given us a Prey to their Teeth; our Soul is e≈øcaped, as a Bird out of the Snare of the Fowler; the Snare is broken, and we are e≈øcaped: our help is in the Name of the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth.</hi> And indeed it has been no le≈øs in all Ages of the World; for any Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from a ≈øharp and torturing pain, or from an extream peril and danger, concludes that Deliverance an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110034:5"/>Happine≈øs; then it behoves us to rai≈øe our Souls to a highth that may fill us with Joy, for a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Deliverance, in con≈øidering the Royal In≈øtrument is in the Hand of the Authour of all our Happine≈øs, from whom we have our being, and our well-being; for as it is written, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.11. <hi>He that loveth purene≈øs of Heart, for the Grace of his Lips, the King ≈øhall be his Friend.</hi> And what can be more de≈øira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? for the favour of a Righteous Prince is more excellent than Gold, and his Love above the price of all precious things; he ≈øits fearle≈øs from Danger, and is the brightne≈øs and lu≈øtre of his Kingdom: And as a more excellent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pethite, the wi≈øe Man ≈øays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.14. <hi>The King that faithfully judgeth the Poor his Throne ≈øhall be e≈øtabli≈øhed for ever;</hi> and, as no ≈ømall honour, and peculiar favour of Heaven, even the Church of Chri≈øt hath a comfortable Promi≈øe, <hi>viz. That Kings ≈øhall be her nur≈øing Fathers, and Queens her nur≈øing Mothers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The≈øe things bring us to a further con≈øideration, which may more and more open our Eyes to behold what may make us with a Holy Zeal cry out,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110034:5"/>
               <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in our Eyes;</hi> for who but a ≈øhort time ≈øince could have fore≈øeen the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles he has done by the Prudence, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Courage of the happy In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his hand, which in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance required Vertues, hardly to be credited, till ≈øeen. Great indeed, have been the Actions and Fame of Men in mo≈øt Ages, for being renowned in War, celebrated in Learning, or excellent in curious Arts, which has cau≈øed their Names to be Regi≈øtred in the Golden Robes of Fame; but in this the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is va≈øtly tran≈øcendent, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wonder and a≈øtoni≈øhment can fill our minds, whil≈øt we contemplate it, and are carried away with thoughts of our happine≈øs, <hi>when the Righteous are in authority, the people rejoice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come nearer, there ought to be in this Ca≈øe a great and more than ordinary ≈øen≈øe of the highe≈øt Gratitude incumbent on us; and fir≈øt let us lift our Eyes to Heaven, and give hearty Prai≈øe and Acknowledgment, adoring his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Mercy, confe≈ø≈øing with Holy <hi>David, P≈øal.</hi> 126. v. 3. <hi>The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110034:6"/>glad;</hi> &amp; e≈øpecially according to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews, Heb.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Let Brotherly Love continue.</hi> Let us own our ≈øelves unworthy of ≈øo great a Ble≈ø≈øing, and humble our ≈øelves before him that exalteth the lowly, and aba≈øeth the Proud: Let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ways to the Lord, and put our Tru≈øt in the Shield and Rock of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ever ble≈øs his Holy Name, that we live to ≈øee this happy day, in which we beheld the Work of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance ≈øo fully wrought, and as our Hearts ought ever to be full charged with Joy, for the Peace and welfare of <hi>Zion,</hi> ≈øo let us ≈øtudy to pre≈øerve &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it to the utmo≈øt of our power, by uniting in Peace, and Unity, that by our Breaches or Divi≈øions, we may give the Enemy to advantage over us, that by the old <hi>Machiavilian</hi> Policy we may not divide, thereby to ≈øuffer breaking in or going out; and that there may be no murmuring or complaining in our Streets. We, no doubt, are one of the be≈øt Governments, founded upon whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome and ≈øub≈øtantial Laws; the Purity of the Go≈øpel ≈øhines bright as the Morning-Star among≈øt us, Plenty flows in our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110034:6"/>Land, and the Oppre≈ø≈øours are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from our Gates; let us then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our ≈øelves a People in a happy Condition; yea, rather let us conclude our ≈øelves ≈øo, becau≈øe our <hi>God is the Lord,</hi> who, with a mighty and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtretched Arm, has rai≈øed up Salvation to us, and heard us out of his Holy Hill in the time of trouble, and has bound him≈øelf by a holy promi≈øe, if we provoke him not by our ≈øins, he will never leave nor for≈øake us. O! that Men would therefore Prai≈øe the Lord.</p>
            <p>But ≈øecondly, O <hi>let us Ki≈øs the Son, lea≈øt after all the≈øe Mercies, he be angry, and his anger burn again≈øt us, for making no better u≈øe of ≈øo great a Mercy. A Wi≈øe Man is as ≈øtedfa≈øt as the Foundation of the Earth,</hi> ≈øays the Philo≈øopher, and in Holy Scripture finds, he builds a Hou≈øe upon a Rock, and that Rock is Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the Son of God, and therefore his Hou≈øe is never ≈øhaken down, though the Storms or Tempe≈øts be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øo rough and raging, <hi>He that tru≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Lord, ≈øhall ≈øtand as Mount Sion.</hi> This made Holy <hi>David</hi> bold, when he ≈øaid, P≈øal. 23. <hi>Though I ≈øhould walk through the Valley of the Shadow of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110034:7"/>Death, I will fear no Evil; for thou art with me, thy Red and thy Staff, they ≈øhall comfort me</hi> and again, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 27. <hi>The Lord is my Light and my Salvation, whom ≈øhall I fear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Ezekiah</hi> heard the proud Me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage of a Scribe ≈øent to him and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by <hi>Rab≈øhaketh</hi> the King, ≈øtood not much to con≈øult the Arm of Fle≈øh, but went unto the Hou≈øe of the Lord, and prayed unto the Lord to ≈øave him and his people out of the hands of their Enemies, that all the Kingdoms of the Earth might know he is alone God, and accordingly the A≈ø≈øyrian Ho≈øt fell before them, without any lo≈øs to the I≈øraelites. This Miraculous Deliverence may in ≈øomemea≈øure be applyed to our Ca≈øe; God ≈øent his Angel to put fear into the Hearts of tho≈øe who, a little before, thought of nothing but our Ruine, bla≈øting and withering all their Courage, and enfeebling them, that they were not able to carry on their Devices to any kind of perfection, that had co≈øt them extraordinary Trea≈øure, Labour and Indu≈øtry. This we mu≈øt own to be the Lord's doing; for it is mo≈øt plainly demon≈øtrated, as it was revealed to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110034:7"/>great Babilonian Monarch, that the mo≈øt High God rules in the Kingdoms of Men, and gives them to whom he plea≈øes; 'Tis he that rules the Hearts of Kings and Princes, di≈øpo≈øing of them as it ≈øeemeth be≈øt to his Godly Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; all Crowns and Scepters are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and in his Hands are the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances of the Earth; his looks dry up the Deep, and the Winds are in the hollow of his hand; Power and Might are ever before him, to do what ≈øeems be≈øt to his infinite Wi≈ødom; for whatever he wills, that he has Power to perform. The≈øe things con≈øidered, What Per≈øons ought we to be in all Holine≈øs and Conver≈øation, that he may continue his Love and Favour towards us, that he continue his Protection and Favour towards us? for although his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is, and has been very great, yet if we triffle with ≈øuch tran≈øcendent Goodne≈øs, What can we expect, but that he ≈øhould change his Smiles into Frowns, as hath happened to many, who have turned his Grace into wantonne≈øs? <hi>O let us not, like Ge≈ø≈øerun, wax Fat, and kick again≈øt our Maker; but rather ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly con≈øider what he has done for this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110034:8"/>Land and People,</hi> with all the thoughts of Humility and Gratitude, that we enjoy the Royal Ble≈ø≈øings, on who≈øe Heads the Crowns flouri≈øh in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs, and may their Thrones be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtabli≈øhed, that every one ≈øits under his Vine in peace, not con≈øtrained or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to violate his Con≈øcience, or to undergoe hard-≈øhips upon the Score of Con≈øcience or Religion: And the better to mind us of it, let us look back a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into the times of Per≈øecution, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Saints of God ≈øuffered all manner of ignominy, and torment, being hated of all Men for the Name of Chri≈øt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpi≈øed as the Filth of the World and Dung of the Earth; yet they continued faithfull and con≈øtant, arming their Hearts with the comforts of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes in his Go≈øpel, and were ≈øo far from repining, that they ≈øuffered joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and many run violently to flames and torments, not accepting Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ≈øinging Triumphs, even in the Arms of Death; and when they were called before Kings and Princes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Authority, and commanded to for≈øake the Truth of the everla≈øting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel, they notwith≈øtanding continued
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110034:8"/>faithfull unto Death, to gain a Crown of Life and glorious Immortality.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Tryalls, I ≈øay, are not before us, we live at Peace under a Pious and Vertuous King and Queen, who make Religion the brighte≈øt Jewels in their Crowns, and the highe≈øt concernment of Regal Glory: We live under ≈øuch Laws as guard and ≈øecure our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Lives, Liberties and Properties to us. This might rai≈øe us to the Rapture of the Kingly Prophet, when he ≈øays, <hi>Thou Lord, ≈øhalt have both Man and Bea≈øt, how excellent are thy Mercies, O God! and the Children of men ≈øhall put their tru≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ≈øhadow of thy Wings; they ≈øhall be ≈øatisfied with the plenteou≈øne≈øs of thy Hou≈øe, and thou ≈øhalt give them to drink at thy plea≈øure, as out of a River; for with thee is the Well of Lafe, and in thee we ≈øhall ≈øee Light,</hi> P≈øal. 36.7, 8, 9. and certainly no Eye can perceive, nor Heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the high and ≈øudden plea≈øures which God has in ≈øtore, for tho≈øe that with thankfull Hearts and Minds obey, and ≈øerve him; be earne≈øt then, in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Race that is ≈øet before you, contend for the Prize of an ine≈øtimable value, that may Crown you with Imor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110034:9"/>mu≈øt rai≈øe the mind to a very high pitch, though ≈øupported with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary vertue; but when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider this world, and the Fa≈øhion of it pa≈ø≈øes away, of what little moment and duration all earthly things con≈øi≈øt, then we mu≈øt confe≈øs them of two ≈ømall a value to ≈øix our hearts upon, and own that here we have no tarrying City, but look for one above, the bright cele≈øtial City, the new <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> there our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect joys will be made full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, when we ≈øhall be found worthy to attend on the Throne of the King of Kings, with Songs of Prai≈øe and Thank≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and our Fellow-Courtiers ≈øhall Seraphim, Cherubim, Arch-Angels, Patriarchs, Apo≈øtles, Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and all the Souls of ju≈øt men made perfect. The≈øe are things worthy of our highe≈øt contemplation, and the Stairs that lead to this Man≈øion, built without hands, are Faith, Hope, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Ju≈øtice, Uprightne≈øs, and many other Graces and Vertues, that ought to ≈øhine in the Soul of a good Chri≈øtian, as the Stars in the Firmament guiding him through the Wilderne≈øs of this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110034:10"/>World, that he wander not into the Paths of error, which at the enterance appear in pro≈øpect exceeding fair, and many times be de≈øired, but are full of ≈øtumbling Blocks, and paved with Ruine, to overthrow and bring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, ≈øuch as go a≈øtray, and of this the Wi≈øe man gives us an <hi>Item, Prov.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Who≈øe walketh uprightly ≈øhall be ≈øaved, but he that is prever≈øe in his ways, ≈øhall fall at once,</hi> and this brings me to the third con≈øideration and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to follow the way of vertue and uprightne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Since the Wi≈ødom of the Father has declared, that by him Kings Reign, and Princes decree Ju≈øtice and Judgment, we ought to look upon them as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary per≈øons, with a di≈øtence, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect and obedience, becoming the highe≈øt Character upon Earth; and more immediately charged by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty with the care of the Kingdom, Nation, or People, committed to their Tru≈øt and Care; and here we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to tender to <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> the Things that are <hi>Cae≈øars,</hi> Rom. 13 8. <hi>And let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Soul be ≈øubject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

            </p>
            <p>The≈øe are the Commands of Heaven, carrying with them an undi≈øputable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which demands our Obedience in ≈øo ≈øtrict a ≈øen≈øe, that they leave us no place of turning to the right, or the left, and therefore our Circum≈øpection mu≈øt be great; but a good Prince even commands the Hearts of his Subjects, and there flows a univer≈øal concurrence in Duty and Affection, from ≈øecret Springs of the mind; <hi>for when the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are in Authority the People rejoice.</hi> A good Man, a value and e≈øteem in≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from vertuous Actions, which gives Life to tho≈øe that are Influenced by him, and obliges them to Joy and

            <p>I might lay down many particulars more than are already mentioned, to exhort and per≈øuade all to true Loyalty and Obedience, but think it, in our Ca≈øe, altogether needle≈øs in a generous Nation, who≈øe Souls ≈øcorn any thing beneath them≈øelves, and hold it the blacke≈øt of all Crimes to be branded with Ingratitude, unle≈øs by the way I ≈øhould take notice of the Sons of <hi>Rome,</hi> who are bigotted into Opinions, for which they cannot give us the lea≈øt Rea≈øon, unle≈øs they ≈øhuffle it upon a blind Obedience to their pretended ≈øpiritual head, who ≈øits upon his ≈øeven Hills, and ≈øends his Foxes with Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands at their Tails to inflame the World; but we find his Mea≈øures have been taken ami≈øs, the Snare is broken,
